# various social media tools

(Need to write todo)

For example, you can do the following:

./runytchatmon.sh EiEKGFVDRzd5SVd0VndjRU5nX1pTLW5haGc1ZxIFL2xpdmU | tabformatter/tabformatter |  ./addtime.sh  | ./rundiscordposter.sh



Also, we can post messages to livechats as a specific user but it needs oauth instead of an API key.  You can do that by first running the yt_oauth_helper.

```
cd yt_oauth_helper
make
./yt_oauth_helper
```
